## FakeAutoStop V1.0 - Vuze Plugin

***

### Description

This plugin will automatically stop the torrent from leeching or seeding when it has reached a ratio limit as indicated by the user.

This feature needs Vuze 5.7.5.0 with (\* hack) to work.

The hack must contain modified code in it. So it will not work right off the bat. Send me an email or im if you want a copy.
